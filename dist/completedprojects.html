                        north island
                        repairing foundation problems in peopleâ€™s homes. The husband/wife partnership decided they
                        wanted a
                        fresh launch of their business, and I wanted to grab the attention of customers as soon as they
                        loaded the page.
                        We decided to start simple with a single page website. Links at the top smoothly scroll to each
                        section using native smooth scrolling.
                        The website is currently live at https://repilingdoctor.co.nz/

                <h2>2.Honey App</h2>
                <p class="p-text"> A masters student was doing their thesis on the blockchain and as
                    part of it contracted me to create a web-based app prototype which interfaced with an IBM
                    blockchain
                    API they had made. The purpose of the project is to assist in Quality Assurance throughout the
                    entire supply chain of New Zealand produced honey - from beekeepers to overseas shops.
                    With some assistance communicating with API, I managed to deliver
                    enough of a good looking prototype by the thesis presentation
                    deadline that the professors and ultimately the customer was very happy. This was a challenging
                    project because of the short timeframe and
                    poorly communicated requirements (and unfinished API). This took a lot of initiative and running
                    wireframes by the customer before actually implementing any pages.

                    <strong>Packing And Shipping Pages</strong><br> Packing is where raw honey is packed into jars and
                    boxes. Honey is
                    carefully weighed and recorded along with the test results of the batch. All information is signed
                    together on the IBM blockchain backend to prove each successive part of the supply chain.<br>
                    Shipping Page:From storage in a warehouse, orders are shipped to stores
                    internationally. The blockchain powering the app allows any jar of honey to be traced back to their
                    test results and manuka source.
