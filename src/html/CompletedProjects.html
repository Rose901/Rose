                        <p class="p-text"> The repiling doctors are a small company based south of Hamilton. They travel
                            the
                            north island
                            repairing foundation problems in peopleâ€™s homes. The husband/wife partnership decided they
                            wanted a
                            fresh launch of their business, and I wanted to grab the attention of customers as soon as
                            they
                            loaded the page.
                            We decided to start simple with a single page website. Links at the top smoothly scroll to
                            each
                            section using native smooth scrolling.
                            The website is currently live at https://repilingdoctor.co.nz/

                <h4>2.Honey App</h4>
                <p class="p-text"> A masters student was doing their thesis on the blockchain and as
                    part of it contracted me to create a web-based app prototype which interfaced with an IBM
                    blockchain
                    API they had made. The purpose of the project is to assist in Quality Assurance throughout the
                    entire supply chain of New Zealand produced honey - from beekeepers to overseas shops.
                    With some assistance communicating with API, I managed to deliver
                    enough of a good looking prototype by the thesis presentation
                    deadline that the professors and ultimately the customer was very happy. This was a challenging
                    project because of the short timeframe and
                    poorly communicated requirements (and unfinished API). This took a lot of initiative and running
                    wireframes by the customer before actually implementing any pages.

                        their
                        test results and manuka source.
