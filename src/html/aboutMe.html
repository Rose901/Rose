                    <p class="p-text"> Hi, I’m Rose!
                        Around two years ago I started learning to code. I have studied online from various up-to-date
                        learning resources such as w3shools, MDN, Css-tricks, Stackoverflow, Youtube, and some premium
                        Chinese websites. I subscribed to the online school Treehouse for further knowledge and
                        practice.</p>

                    <p class="p-text"> I am so lucky that with my partner’s help I have had the chance to work for real
                        customers on a
                        couple of contracts. As a senior developer, he helped to gather requirements and assisted with
                        some more difficult technical problems. You can see more about these completed projects here.
                    </p>

                    <p class="p-text"> I think that to be a web developer, the most import thing is to have a strong
                        self-learning
                        ability & team cooperation spirit. </p>

                    How I choose to learn code
                </h2>
                <div class="slide-left-text animatable">
                    <p class="p-text"> Before learning programming most of my jobs were as a sales person, both in China
                        and in New
                        Zealand. Some people have asked me why I chose to become a web developer when they hear I am
                        studying seriously.</p>

                    <p class="p-text"> The answer is not so simple. Actually, I like any beautiful thing: a modern web
                        design, a well
                        decorated house and garden, or a gorgeous painting. In fact, each time when I see some nice and
                        cool websites I feel so excited and often inspired. I plan how I can make websites like that. I
                        enjoy writing the code behind the scenes, and seeing the end result in the browser. It is so
                        cool, man! That is why I choose to be a web developer.</p>

                    <p class="slide-right-text p-text"> I am between extroverted and Introverted. With a quiet
                        environment I can focus on
                        doing
                        something
                        for a whole day or even a whole week. But I also like to go out and make friends or meet new
                        people.
                        One of my favourite things to do is drink a cup of tea or coffee in the beautiful sunshine with
                        friends or alone,
                        for me both options are enjoyable. I also like to cook healthy and delicious food nearly every
                        day.
                        When I feel stressed I like to go for a walk, do yoga, or listen to some relaxing music.
                        I try to see the positive in all things. Life is beautiful but too short, so we should cherish
                        every day!</p>
