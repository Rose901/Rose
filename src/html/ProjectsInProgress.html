                <p class="web-introduce p-text"> <strong>Truth lambs</strong> is the code word for a
                    project still in
                    progress.
                    The website is ambitious because it has similar ideas to existing sites like Quora and Stack
                    Exchange.
                    It is being built by a team of volunteers in their spare time. I joined the team in 2018 and
                    liked
                    the
                    vision of the website that allowed people to freely discuss spiritial questions and ideas. I
                    offered
                    my
                    time to build the front-end for the website. My partner created the initial graphic designs and
                    I
                    implemented the website to be modern and responsive using mostly Bootstrap 4, Sass and
                    Lightboxes.

            <h3> 4. Little Trees</h3>
            <p class="web-introduce p-text"> <strong>Little Trees</strong>
                is the code word for an online language teaching website.
                The website will be launched publically this year and will be targeted
                initially at teaching Chinese students to speak English.<br>
                Students and techers both need to login to the website and talk face
                to face with one another. We currently have three developers working on the
                project part-time including myself.
                As the website is quite complex we are using react, reactstrap and redux for
                the font-end. The backend is built on top of the Wordpress REST api.
                This combines all the skills I have learned up to now and pushes me further
                to learn the latest libraries and language features of javascript.
